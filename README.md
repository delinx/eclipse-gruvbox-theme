# eclipse-gruvbox-theme

A [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) color theme for Eclipse.

There is a gruvbox theme on http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org, but I do not like the combination of the colors.
This is an attempt to match the original colors, as shown on the gruvbox project.

Some colors could be changed. I have to test it.
If you have suggestions just create an issue.
